# requirements_prep.txt for Data Preprocessing (prepdocs.py)

# Azure SDKs for Preprocessing
azure-identity              # For Azure authentication (e.g., Azure CLI Credential)
azure-search-documents      # For Azure AI Search (using stable release)
azure-storage-blob         # For Azure Blob Storage interaction
openai          # For Azure OpenAI / OpenAI API (Embeddings)
azure-ai-documentintelligence # For Document Intelligence (used in prepdocs.py for non-MD files or complex parsing)

# RAG Utilities
tiktoken                     # For token counting

# Configuration and Helpers
python-dotenv                # Assuming load_azd_env uses this or similar mechanism
# load_azd_env                      # If load_azd_env is a published package, list it here. If it's a local script, ensure it's present.

# Logging and File Parsing Dependencies seen in prepdocs.py
rich>=13.0.0                        # Used for enhanced logging output in prepdocs.py
aiohttp>=3.8.0                      # Often needed by async Azure SDKs
pymupdf>=1.24.0                     # Dependency for LocalPdfParser used in prepdocs.py
beautifulsoup4>=4.12.0              # Dependency for LocalHTMLParser used in prepdocs.py
isodate                             # Often required by Azure SDKs for date parsing

# --- Notes ---
# - This assumes 'prepdocslib' is local Python code available to prepdocs.py.
# - This list includes dependencies for features present in prepdocs.py (like PDF/HTML parsing fallbacks, DI),
#   even if you currently only process Markdown files. This ensures the script runs as written.
# - You do NOT need botbuilder-* or aiohttp-cors here.
